        <h1>Beats By Dre</h1>
        
        <p>Beats Electronics, LLC is an American producer of audio products and equipment headquartered in Santa Monica, California.The company was founded by rapper and hip-hop producer Andre "Dr. Dre" Young and Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records chairman Jimmy Iovine and primarily produces products under the brand Beats .</p>
        
        <h2>History of Beats</h2>
        <p>he company was formally established in 2008,and debuted its first product, Beats by Dr. Dre Studio headphones, in late 2008. Monster Cable was granted exclusive rights under a 5-year contract to manufacture and develop the first Beats-branded products. To promote its products, Beats primarily relied on endorsements by pop and hip-hop music performers, product placement within music videos, and partnering with musicians and other celebrities to develop co-branded products.In August 2011, mobile phone manufacturer HTC acquired a 50.1% majority share in Beats for $309 million. The purchase was intended to allow HTC to compete with other cellphone makers by associating themselves with the Beats brand,as the purchase also granted HTC exclusive rights to manufacture smartphones with Beats-branded audio systems. Despite its majority acquisition, HTC would still allow Beats to operate as an autonomous company.</p>

        <p>On July 2, 2012, Beats announced it had acquired the online music service MOG, in a purchase reported to have been between $10 million to $16 million. Beats stated that the acquisition was part of the company's goal to develop a "truly end-to-end music experience." The acquisition did not include the company's blog and advertising network, the MOG Music Network,which was sold in a separate transaction to the broadcasting company Townsquare Media in August 2012. While MOG indicated that it would continue to operate independently with no immediate change in service, Beats subsequently announced a new, subscription-based online music service known as Beats Music, which will launch on January 21, 2014. In comparison to its competitors, such as Spotify and Google Play Music, the service will emphasize recommendations by music professionals alongside algorithmic recommendations </p>
